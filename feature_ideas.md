# Feature Ideas

## 1. Session Compaction
**Inspired by:** vicnaum/vics-agent-skills `session-stripper`

Strip tool content, thinking blocks, and large outputs from Claude Code JSONL sessions when context pressure rises. We already track `ctxPct` in `engine.ts` — hook into that to trigger auto-compaction. Could also be a standalone MCP tool (`helot_compact`) that Claude calls manually when context is getting full.

**Value:** Recover 60%+ context on long sessions without losing conversation thread.

## 2. Persistent Directory Context (`helot_map`)
**Inspired by:** vicnaum/vics-agent-skills `layered-summary`

A tool that walks the project tree and writes layered `AGENTS.md` files — detailed in leaf directories, summarised at parent level. Slinger reads these instead of re-crawling on every run.

**Value:** Large projects currently require slinger to re-research the same areas on every `helot_run`. With persistent context files, slinger can orient itself in one read. Big token saving for repeat work.

**Implementation sketch:**
- New `helot_map` MCP tool
- Hoplite walks dirs, writes `AGENTS.md` per directory
- Slinger checks for `AGENTS.md` at target path before issuing READLINES/GREP commands

## 3. Project Onboarding (`helot_init`)
**Inspired by:** vicnaum/vics-agent-skills `init-context`

Parallel sub-agent exploration of root docs, source dirs, tests, CI, and git history. Synthesises into architecture brief, open work items, and "where to find things" reference — written to `.helot-mcp-connector/project-context.md`.

**Value:** First-run orientation for new projects. Replaces ad-hoc slinger research at session start. Output feeds into global context for all subsequent runs.

**Implementation sketch:**
- `helot_init` MCP tool (or a skill wrapping `helot_workflow`)
- Multiple parallel slinger calls via `helot_workflow` steps
- Hoplite synthesises into structured `project-context.md`
- Engine auto-loads `project-context.md` into global context if present

---

## 4. Session Checkpoint (`helot_checkpoint`)
**Inspired by:** ksenxx/kiss_ai `RelentlessAgent`

At end of session (or on demand), synthesise `events.jsonl` + recent commits + `MEMORY.md` into a structured resumable brief at `.helot-mcp-connector/session-brief.md`. The `SessionStart` hook auto-injects it into context so the next session starts already oriented — no re-explanation needed.

**Problem it solves:** Currently 5-6 sessions per day restart cold. Each requires re-reading commits, re-explaining context, re-orienting. This is pure waste.

**Brief structure:**
```
## What was built this session
## What's in progress / half-done
## Decisions made and why
## Files changed
## Next steps
```

**Implementation sketch:**
- `helot_checkpoint` MCP tool — calls hoplite to read `events.jsonl` + git log + `MEMORY.md`, write `session-brief.md`
- Also trigger automatically when `ctxPct` exceeds threshold (context pressure already tracked in engine)
- `SessionStart` hook reads `session-brief.md` if present and injects as system context
- Lightweight — no sub-session spawning needed, fits existing infrastructure exactly
